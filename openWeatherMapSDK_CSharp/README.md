#Usage

This is a simple Open Weather Map SDK implemented in C#. Of course you can 
add a GUI(Graphical User Interface) to it by simply using a WPF or Winforms ad C# supports both 
of them. I did not add them because you may need this code to integrate into a bigger code 
base. To understand it simply I keep it as a console app.

All you need to make this code show real data in to have an API key 
from openweathermap.org website after registration.
